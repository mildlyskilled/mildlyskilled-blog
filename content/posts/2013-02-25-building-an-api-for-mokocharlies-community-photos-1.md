After a few years of [Mokocharlie](http://mokocharlie.com) creating communities around images, it has become necessary to open up this data to partners who want to provide galleries of their own but don't have the time to go out to curate those images themselves.

To this end the most logical path would be to develop an API that leverages the data we already have, I have chosen [Laravel ](http://laravel.com)for this project. Over the next few weeks I will be blogging about the progress made on this project, from architecture to design decisions etc. The outline will be as follows:

  * Basic Architecture (How clients will connect to this service, authentication protocols, etc)
  * Data Formats/Structures
  * Content provision and distribution
  * Logging and Monitoring
  * Case Studies
  * Further work.
