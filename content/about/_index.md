## About Me
The proliferation of the concurrent models, and frameworks that support these models have been a clear sign of the direction of software design and architecture; this model inherently supports the properties required for distributed and concurrent computing. My research area is in concurrent software design and architectures - with an inclination towards the Actor Model of Concurrent Computing. I am also a lead software engineer, and have been interested in building software for longer than I can remember.

I'm mostly interested in:

* Programming Languages
* Software Design and Engineering
* Concurrent Systems and Models
* Asynchronous Processing

I also work as a Lead Software Engineer with the Big Data Team at Elsevier
