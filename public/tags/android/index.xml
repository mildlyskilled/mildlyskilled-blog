      <description>After a massive break from hacking on Mokocharlie, I felt like I needed to get my mind of some other things and perhaps do something that I found to be fun on a weekend.
I have been meaning to build a ReSTful API for Moko for a while now, I experimented with PHP a long time ago. It was OK but I&amp;rsquo;m in a different space now so I decided to go with the Akka stack, and perhaps use Slick for the data layer.</description>
