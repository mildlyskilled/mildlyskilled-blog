      <description>Note to self and perhaps others who might be wondering why your images are not displaying in your tex document. Despite using the correct syntax:
 \begin{figure}[htb] \begin{center} \includegraphics{image.png} \end{center} \caption{Fig 1: image} \label{fig1} \end{figure} 
You may find a box with with only the image path being displayed as your image. Please check that you are not using the &amp;ldquo;draft&amp;rdquo; argument at the top of your document when specifying your document class.</description>

      <title>LyX</title>

      <description>So on recommendations I have installed LyX. I am actually writing this on LyX now. I just thought I should post my thoughts on this programme.
I am not sure why I had not tried this first, it is mainly a WYSISYG editor that outputs LaTeX source or any other LaTeX-like source code for that matter. So you can type documents up as you would in a normal text editor and then not have to worry about all that LaTeX markup that you need to make it look like it should because there are a myriad of buttons you can use for styling.</description>

      <title>LaTeX Editors</title>

      <description>I have been looking into LaTeX (pronounced La Tek) editors for my writing now and after a lot of trials and tribulations, I finally settled on LateXila.
Not only does it look identical to my favourite text editor / IDE of all time - gEdit. It supports syntax highlighting, decent support for BibTex referencing. It also has a very user friendly interface and it&amp;rsquo;s also customizable as per any GTK interface in GNOME.</description>

      <title>Mod_Rewrite and Zend Framework 1.10.x and Ubuntu</title>

      <description>So all the tutorials on configuring your development server to run Zend Framework successfully say that you need to enable mod_rewrite in apache2 so that .htaccess and Zend_Router* works well.
What they all say is to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s loaded and enabled. I will raise my hand and say it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that easy for me to find because Ubuntu lays out Apache2 a little differently from say Fedora. First of all in the /etc/apache2 folder there are a few folders to take note of.</description>
