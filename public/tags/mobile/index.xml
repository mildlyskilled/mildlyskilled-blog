      <description>After a massive break from hacking on Mokocharlie, I felt like I needed to get my mind of some other things and perhaps do something that I found to be fun on a weekend.
I have been meaning to build a ReSTful API for Moko for a while now, I experimented with PHP a long time ago. It was OK but I&amp;rsquo;m in a different space now so I decided to go with the Akka stack, and perhaps use Slick for the data layer.</description>

      <description>Last time out I introduced a basic idea for an API, this post will be about the basic architecture of the API framework. I have been listening to and reading on API best practices published by APIGEE. Although there are one or two things about this guide that I think pidgeon-hole me into certain standards, I agree in most part with a lot of what this e book has to say, I recommend you give it a browse at some point.</description>

      <description>After a few years of Mokocharlie creating communities around images, it has become necessary to open up this data to partners who want to provide galleries of their own but don&amp;rsquo;t have the time to go out to curate those images themselves.
To this end the most logical path would be to develop an API that leverages the data we already have, I have chosen Laravel for this project. Over the next few weeks I will be blogging about the progress made on this project, from architecture to design decisions etc.</description>
