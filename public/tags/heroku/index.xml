      <description>I had an idea of building a content management system with one of the Scala frameworks a while back and I decided on the Play Framework. In the middle of scoping things out in terms of my requirements, I decided that perhaps I did not want to build &amp;ldquo;yet another CMS.&amp;rdquo; My initial idea was to build something like wordpress using Play, but the more I thought about it the more I questioned what exactly I wanted to achieve.</description>
