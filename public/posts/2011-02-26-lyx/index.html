      <h1>LyX</h1>
      <span class="post-date">Sat, Feb 26, 2011</span>
      <p>So on recommendations I have installed LyX. I am actually writing this on LyX now. I just thought I should post my thoughts on this programme.</p>

<p>I am not sure why I had not tried this first, it is mainly a WYSISYG editor that outputs LaTeX source or any other LaTeX-like source code for that matter. So you can type documents up as you would in a normal text editor and then not have to worry about all that LaTeX markup that you need to make it look like it should because there are a myriad of buttons you can use for styling.</p>

<p>I will start first with the interface. It seems very simple to use very straight forward. With the version I am using 1.6.7, I have a choice of two interfaces “Default” and “Classic” I noticed only a few differences between where menu items were placed and the toolbar buttons.</p>

<p>The best thing about this is programme is that you can easily use it to learn a lot more about LaTeX mark up just by being productive, this I like.</p>

<p>The insert command also gives you a drop down of almost everything you would need to insert in a document, from citations to images, labels to index entries unless you&rsquo;re doing some very custom layouts and so on chances are that LyX will probably have what you need as a simple menu item. Then again I haven&rsquo;t been using LaTeX long enough to be sure about this.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I can give a very comprehensive review as I installed and only started using it this evening, but what I think stands it apart from every other editor I have tried is the version control that comes with it. I am not sure what backend manages this yet as I have not delved deeply into it but my first attempt at an “initial commit” failed. I will have to look into this further.</p>

<p>You can also split your screen between the WYSIWIG view and the source where you see valid LyX/LaTeX source being generated as you put your document together as though it were a full blown word processor.</p>

<p>My first impressions of this is that I love it and it is a strong contender to LaTeXilla, which I installed and have been using till now. I will give this one a try this week and see how it works for me. I have to re-iterate though that the good thing about open source and these things in general is that you don&rsquo;t have to choose one as you have not shelled out tonnes of money for a license&hellip;</p>
