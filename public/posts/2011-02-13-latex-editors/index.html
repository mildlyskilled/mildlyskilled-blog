      <h1>LaTeX Editors</h1>
      <span class="post-date">Sun, Feb 13, 2011</span>
      <p>I have been looking into LaTeX (pronounced La Tek) editors for my writing now and after a lot of trials and tribulations, I finally settled on LateXila.</p>

<p>Not only does it look identical to my favourite text editor / IDE of all time - gEdit. It supports syntax highlighting, decent support for BibTex referencing. It also has a very user friendly interface and it&rsquo;s also customizable as per any GTK interface in GNOME.</p>

<p>I have not checked if there are versions for other Operating Systems but I am pretty certain anyone wishing to try this out with any Linux distribution can do it with the built in package/software manager, shipped with it.</p>

<p>This is obviously not to say the others do not have advantages over LaTeXila, this is just the one I have felt most at home with. I have tried the LaTex plug-in for gEdit, that is also quite good especially the support you get when using the \cite command, it handily provides a drop down of keys available in any BibTeX files you have referenced in that LaTeX doument. I haven&rsquo;t played with LaTeXila&rsquo;s preferences extensively so I am not sure if it has that too.</p>

<p>You can find sourceforge page here <a href="http://latexila.sourceforge.net/">http://latexila.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
