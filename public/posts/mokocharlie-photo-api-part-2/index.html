      <h1>Building an API for Mokocharlie&#39;s Community photos 2</h1>
      <span class="post-date">Wed, Feb 27, 2013</span>
      

<p>Last time out I introduced a basic idea for an API, this post will be about the basic architecture of the API framework. I have been listening to and reading on API best practices published by <a href="http://offers.apigee.com/ebook-api-design-yt/," title="Web API Design">APIGEE</a>. Although there are one or two things about this guide that I think pidgeon-hole me into certain standards, I agree in most part with a lot of what this e book has to say, I recommend you give it a browse at some point.</p>

<h2 id="basic-architecture">Basic Architecture</h2>

<p>Enough of this, on to the main point of this post. At the moment <a href="http://mokocharlie.com" title="Mokocharlie">Mokocharlie</a> is built on top of the <a href="http://framework.zend.com" title="Zend Framework">Zend Framework</a>. I put a lot of effort into that and I am not planning on rewriting it soon, I don&rsquo;t know maybe when we bump up versions to v5 (we are currently in v4). I will be building the API with <a href="http://four.laravel.com">Laravel 4</a>, although at the time of writing this it has not been officially released, I think there&rsquo;s enough stability in there to actually use it. So without further ado we proceed.</p>

<h3 id="get-composer">Get Composer</h3>

<p>If at this time you do not have composer installed on your computer please go <a href="http://getcomposer.com," title="Get composer">here</a> and install it now. I chose to do a global installation but you can do whatever you like as long as calling composer in your Laravel working directory works.</p>

<h3 id="get-laravel-4">Get Laravel 4</h3>

<ul>
<li>And set up your version control (optional but highly recommended)
Get the latest snapshot of the <a href="http://four.laravel.com" title="Laravel 4">Laravel 4</a>, at this point you can set up a repository to manage your code. We use <a href="http://www.unfuddle.com" title="Unfuddle">unfuddle</a> for all our mokocharlie projects and this will be no different.
I have however found that the best way to get laravel working as a moving target is track the <a href="https://github.com/laravel/laravel">github repository</a>.</li>

<li><p>I create a branch on my local laravel installation called &ldquo;laravel-tracker&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>git checkout -b laravel-tracker
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Add a remote and call it laravel with the url for the laravel git repo</p>

<pre><code>git remote add laravel git@github.com:laravel/laravel.git
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Before I start working on anything I make sure I am in master and then do a git pull on the develop branch from laravel</p>

<pre><code>git checkout laravel-tracker
git pull laravel develop
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Do a composer update</p>

<pre><code>composer update
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Make sure the application is not broken</p>

<pre><code>php artisan serve
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>If I am happy with what I see (in most cases I am), I just kill the server and then checkout master and continue working</p></li>
</ul>
